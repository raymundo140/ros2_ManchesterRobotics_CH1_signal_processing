# ROS 2 Signal Processing - Challenge 1

This project implements a **signal processing system in ROS 2**, consisting of two main nodes:
- **`signal_generator.py`**: Generates a sinusoidal wave and publishes it in ROS 2.
- **`process.py`**: Receives the sine wave, applies transformations (phase shift, amplitude scaling, and vertical offset), and republishes the processed signal.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements
This project was developed in **Ubuntu 22.04** using **ROS 2 Humble**. Before running it, make sure you have:
- **Python 3**
- **ROS 2 Humble**
- **PlotJuggler** (for real-time visualization)
